‚úÖ When user confirmed the appointment, the bot will automatically send a notification message to an admin chat.
Also it will automatically remove all the booked time, including time, that will be needed for providing the service.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Admin panel
Admin can access admin panel by typing command /admin_#password#, the admin password is generated with bot creation. After typing the command, an admin panel button will appear, after clicking it a web app will be opened. All the information can be edited or added.

## üöÄ Some ideas:
1. Create website, which will show all the appointmens and some statistics
2. Create free version of the bot
3. Create a system, which will automatically create a new version of the bot for a new user
4. Somehow optimize the hall bot and create tests
